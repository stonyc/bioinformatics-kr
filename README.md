# **PURPOSE**

Although I have moved on to adtech, I maintain an interest in bioinformatics/biotech in Korea. For people looking for jobs in bioinformatics/biotech in Korea, many job websites have limited penetration in the Korean market and some Korean websites are not easily accessible. Formatting will evolve as more companies are added.
